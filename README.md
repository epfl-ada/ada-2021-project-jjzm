# JJZM Project - M2 Outline

## Abstract

## Research questions

1. What political paries have talked the most about climate change in the media?
2. Does the age of the speaker cause difference in the attitude and concerns one has about the climate change?
3. Analysis of climate change concerns in different regions of the world. REFORMULATE!!!
4. What are the biggest concerns about the climate change in the world?

## Proposed additional datasets

For our research questions we will not need any additional datasets, except from the information gotten from Wikidata. More precisely, we are enriching the Quotebank dataset with additional data about the speaker - their nationality and political party.

## Methods

- Fasttext
- Observational studies??
- TextRank 
- LexRank
- LSA Latent Semantic Analysis

## Proposed timeline

- 19.11 Deviding countries of the nationalities into regions based on geographical and social-economical aspect combined, performing additionl analysis between different regions and the popularity of the climate change topic in quotes from those regions, distinguishing between leftwing and rightwing parties 
- 26.11 Checking the results of analysis 
- 03.12 Analysing the first results of fasttext classification and text summarization algorithms
- 10.12 Comparing performances of summarization and classification methods
- 17.12 Finalizing README, Final comments on the code and performed analysis, Finalizing data story

## Organization within the team

- Jovana: Preparing the data for future work, performing the text summarization algorithms and comparing the results
- Maxence: Planning the data story and the final readme file
- Zoran: Implementing the classification using the fasttext library
- Jonatan: Primary data analysis, visualization of the key features for our problem, plotting the results
