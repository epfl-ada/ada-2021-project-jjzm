# JJZM Project - M2 Outline

## Abstract

## Research questions

1. What political paries have talked the most about climate change in the media?
2. Does the age of the speaker cause difference in the attitude and concerns one has about the climate change?
3. Analysis of climate change concerns in different regions of the world. 

## Proposed additional datasets

For our research questions we will not need any additional datasets, except from the information gotten from Wikidata. More precisely we are enriching the Quotebank dataset with additional data about the speaker - their nationality and political party.
